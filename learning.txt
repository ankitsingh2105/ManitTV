1. The WebSocket connection starts its life with an HTTP or HTTPS handshake. When the page is accessed through HTTP, you can use WS or WSS (WebSocket secure: WS over TLS) . However, when your page is loaded through HTTPS, you can only use WSS - browsers don't allow to "downgrade" security.


2. You can't use WebSockets over HTTPS, but you can use WebSockets over TLS (HTTPS is HTTP over TLS). Just use "wss://" in the URI.

3. Yes, you're absolutely right! HTTP is often used for public data because it doesn't have the overhead of encryption and decryption, making it slightly faster than HTTPS in some cases.

   --HTTPS needs a TLS handshake between client and server before data transfer.

   --HTTP skips this step, reducing the initial delay.


4. Why HTTPS is Still Preferred?
  ðŸ”’ Even though HTTP is faster, security is more important in most cases:

  Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Hackers can intercept HTTP data.

  SEO & Browser Warnings: Modern browsers mark HTTP sites as "Not Secure."

  Data Integrity: HTTPS ensures data isn't tampered with in transit.
